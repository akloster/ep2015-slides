Brainwave for Hackers 2.0 Slides
====================

As held on EuroPython 2015 in Bilbao.
------

The presentation is an IPython notebook file running with Damian Avila's Live reveal. To read it, you only need the Jupyter/IPython notebook and the live_reveal / RISE extension. To execute it you also need a Neurosky Mindwave Headset, and my libraries "pysiology", "nb-assets" and "table-cleaner". You may also need a current Bokeh installation.

At the time of the talk, the Pysiology framework has to run on the same computer, because of the websocket connection and the missing configuration options. Also you need to change server.py to use your Mindwave Mobile's Bluetooth Device ID.

The Slides contain "Notes" which are not seen in the presentation but explain the different parts beyond what the slides can do. My philosophy in presentations is that my slides should be small an concise. I don't like long lists of bulletpoints because they distract the audience and tempt me to just read them.
